Hey there 👋

I’m Ahmet, a software engineering student based in Cyprus.

I’m interested in Machine Learning, AI, and core computer science topics.

In my free time, I focus on improving myself through projects, studying algorithms, and learning new technologies.

This is a fresh profile where I’ll be sharing small projects, experiments, and things I’m currently working on. Everything here is built from scratch as part of my learning journey.
